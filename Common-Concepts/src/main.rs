    Int types

    There are several types, 8 bit , 16 bit, 32 bit, 64 bit and 128 bits. there's also one that depends on the architecture of your CPU (32 bit, 64 bit, etc) that is represented with `size`.
    These can be signed (Can be positive or negative) or unsigned (only positive). Signed has a range of -(2^n-1) -> (2^n-1) - 1, and unsigned 0 -> (2^n-1) - 1
    The main reason to use the size one is when you're indexing a collection

    By default, Rust makes all integers i32

    You can use _ between numbers to make it easier to read
    1000000 -> 1_000_000
